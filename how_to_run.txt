1. Save the provided `enhanced_model.py`, `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, and the `index.html` file (inside a `templates` folder) into the same directory.
   - Create a folder named `templates` and place `index.html` inside it.
   - Create a folder named `model` in the root directory.

2. Place your trained Deepfake Detector model (e.g., `deepfake_detector_model.keras`) into the `model` folder.
   - The model should be a Keras model saved as a `.keras` file (not `.h5`).
   - It should be trained for binary classification, outputting a single probability (e.g., using `sigmoid` activation for the last layer) for the 'fake' class.

3. Install the required Python packages:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the Flask application:
   python app.py

5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

6. Upload an image to test the Deepfake Detector and view the XAI explanations.
